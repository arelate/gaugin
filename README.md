# gaugin

This project implemented frontend microservice for [arelate/vangogh](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh) that provided UI to browse your GOG.com data. As of [v0.6.0](https://github.com/arelate/vangogh/commit/500ce71fa46c364e489d459ba22e3ce9cc699a22) `vangogh` can serve that frontend itself and gaugin is no longer needed.

The repo is archived.
